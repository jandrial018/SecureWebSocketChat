how do i run this?

**directories will need to be updated**




you'll need to install workerman
	composer require workerman/workerman
	composer require workerman/channel


starting webSocket
	sudo php {your directory}/chatSocket2.php start

to run in the background add '-d'
	sudo php {your directory}/chatSocket2.php start -d

check status
	sudo php {your directory}/chatSocket2.php status

to stop
	sudo php {your directory}/chatSocket2.php stop

restart
	sudo php {your directory}/chatSocket2.php restart


**you will need a https certificate for the socket for secure websocket chat**
	you can use your websites certs or make a new one

	if you do not have one or wish to not use one. you'll need to update both chat2.js and chatSocket2.php.
	for chat2.js replace 'wss' with 'ws' when initializing the connection with the webSocket
	for chatSocket2.php: try removing these lines and see if that works. 
		 $wsWorker->transport = 'ssl'; 
				and 
		 $context
